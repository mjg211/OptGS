Description: OptGS provides a suite of functions to assist with the design,
    analysis, and visualization of randomized two-arm group-sequential clinical
    trials with continuous outcome variables. Specifically, support is provided
    to perform sample size calculations for each of the most popular applicable
    (non-optimal) designs, along with optimal and near-optimal designs.
    Additional functions allow point estimates, p-values, and confidence
    intervals to be determined for possible results in these designs. Plotting
    functions also permit the informative depiction of several important
    quantities.
