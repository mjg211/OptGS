Description: OptGS provides a suite of functions to assist with the design,
    analysis, and visualization of randomized two-arm group-sequential clinical
    trials with continuous outcome variables. Specifically, support is provided
    to perform sample size calculations for popular applicable (non-optimal)
    designs, along with optimal and near-optimal designs. An additional function
    allows point estimates to be determined and point estimators to be
    evaluated. Plotting functions also permit the informative depiction of
    several important quantities. Further details can be found in Wason (2015)
