Stopping boundary shape
=======================

**OptGS** requires a choice to be made about the type of stopping
boundaries (i.e., their shape) to utilise in the to-be-determined
design. Specify your choice here.

If Wang-Tsiatis or power-family boundaries are chosen, additional boxes
will appear to allow their associated shape parameters to be specified.
