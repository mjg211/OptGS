# Stopping boundary shape

__OptGS__ requires a choice to be made about the type of stopping boundaries (i.e., their shape) to utilise in the to-be-determined design. Specify your choice here.

If Wang-Tsiatis or power-family boundaries are chosen, additional boxes will appear to allow their associated shape parameters to be specified.

If near-optimal boundaries are chosen, an additional box will appear to allow the optimality criteria to be specified.
